# Dog-breed-classification

## Project overview
The goal of this project is:
1. If a dog's image is given as input, the model should identify the image as a dog and predict the dog's breed.
2. If a human's image is given as input, the model should identify the image as a human and predict the dog's breed, which would resemble the human face.
3. If any other image is given as input, the model should say that the image is neither human nor dog.

## Motivation:
This project is part of Udacity 'Data science nano degree' program. Image recognition using convolutional neural networks is very interesting.

## File descriptors:
ReadMe.md - A file that contains description about this project.

dog_app.ipynb - A jupyter notebook that contains all the code related to this project.
